    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "Function:\n",
    "* A function is a block of code that is defined using the def keyword and can be called independently.\n",

    "* A method is a function that is associated with an object (usually an instance of a class) and is defined within a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Methods are called on an object or class using dot notation.\n",
    "* The first parameter of a method is always self (for instance methods) or cls (for class methods), which refers to the instance or class itself.\n",
    "* Methods are tied to objects or classes and are used to manipulate or interact with the data within those objects or classes.\n",

    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, iterators and iterables are concepts used in the context of iteration, enabling a user to traverse through the elements of a collection, such as lists, tuples, or dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iterables:\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time, allowing it to be iterated over in a loop. Common examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, sets, and dictionaries. In general, an object is considered iterable if it implements the __iter__().\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists are iterables\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

    "* Strings are iterables\n",

    "* Dictionaries are iterables\n",
    "data = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iterators:\n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and knows how to fetch the next item from the iterable when requested. It must implement two special methods:\n",

    "(6) Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Generators are defined using functions, but instead of using return to return a value, they use the yield keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without executing the function. When the __next__() method is called on this generator object, the function executes until it encounters the yield keyword, which returns the value and pauses the function's execution. The function can be resumed later, starting from where it left off.\n",

    "\n",
    "def count_up_to(max_value):\n",
    "\n",
    "    count = 1\n",
    "    \n",

    "    \n",
    "        yield count\n",
    "        \n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creating a generator object\n",
    "\n",
    "counter = count_up_to(3)\n",

    "*  Fetching values from the generator\n",

    "\n",
    "* print(next(counter))  # Raises StopIteration exception, as no more values are left\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, \n",

    "(7) What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators produce items one at a time and only when required, rather than generating and storing all items in memory at once. This is especially useful when working with large data sets or sequences, as it reduces memory usage significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Lazy Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators use lazy evaluation, meaning they compute values only when needed. This can lead to performance improvements by avoiding unnecessary computations and making the program more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need the first 10 elements of a large sequence, a generator will compute only those 10 elements, not the entire sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improved Performance for Large or Infinite Sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since generators compute values on the fly, they can handle large or even infinite sequences efficiently. This is not feasible with regular functions that return lists or other data structures, as those would consume an impractical amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "def infinite_fibonacci():\n",
    "\n",
    "    a, b = 0, 1\n",

    "        yield a\n",
    "        \n",
    "        a, b = b, a + b\n",

    "\n",
    "for _ in range(10):\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(next(fib_gen))\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Simplified Code:\n",
    " \n",
    "Generators can make code simpler and more readable by eliminating the need for explicit state management. With generators, the state is implicitly managed by the generator's control flow and the yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A generator to yield prime numbers is simpler than implementing the same logic using a class with state variables and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduced Overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators do not require the overhead of creating and returning entire data structures like lists or dictionaries. They also eliminate the need for explicit iteration code, which can reduce the potential for errors and make the code more concise."
